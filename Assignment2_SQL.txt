    city, state or province, and country in the output. Run the query

----> mysql> select location_id, street_address, city, state_province, country_name from locations join countries on  locations.country_id =  countries.country_id;

2) The HR department needs a report of employees in Toronto. Display the last name, job,   
    department number, and department name for all employees who work in Toronto.
----> mysql> select last_name, job_id , employees.department_id , department_name from employees join departments on employees.department_id = departments.department_id;

    King.
  
---->mysql> select m.last_name , m.salary from employees m join employees n ON m.employee_id= n.employee_id where m.manager_id = (select employee_id from employees where last_name="king");

        , 'Ralph'
        , 'rpatel'
        , 895
        );

	INSERT INTO my_employee VALUES 
        ( 2
        , 'Dancs'
        , 'Betty'
        , 'bdancs'
        , 860
        );

        , 'bben'
        , 1100
        );

        , 'Chad'
        , 'cnewman'
        , 750
        );

---->mysql> delete from my_employee;

11) Discard the most recent DELETE operation.
---> mysql> rollback to save;

     department numbers from the EMPLOYEES table. The heading for the employee name should be  
     EMPLOYEE.

     Confirm that the view works. Display the contents of the EMPLOYEES_VU view

---> mysql> create view employee_vul AS select employee_id,last_name AS EMPLOYEE, department_id from employees;
	mysql> select * from employee_vul;
